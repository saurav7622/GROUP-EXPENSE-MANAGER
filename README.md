## Why Group Expense Manager?

There are many scenarios where we often have to pay bills for a group.Be it travels,food-orders in restaurants,flatmates and so on.And it becomes a bit awkward to ask for individuals' contribution for the bill created.

So in order to avoid confusion in the payment of bills and make our group activities go smoothly
,one can easily split the bills through this application.It will bring a sense of formalism to the payment of group expense among friends.On the other side, we can also fully enjoy on our activities rather than keeping burden on stuffs which will be completely managed by this application.

The way it works is like this.First all the members among whom the bill is to be splitted should be registered in the application.Then group creation can be done in any one of the member's account.Each member will have two fields i.e.,his contribution and his currently paying amount.The email will be sent from the account where the group is being created to every group members.Only when all the members click on confirm on his/her gmail,can the group be successfully created.

This application also comes up with the feature of settling up his amount in the application.There can be two cases of the payment status of any group member besides being settled.Either the member is owed i.e, his amount paid is more than his share or he has owed i.e. his amount paid is less than his actual share.
The beared up member can send payment reminder through email to the indebted members of the group.
If the indebted member(s) has completed some payment to the members who is owed, through offline or online, he can ask for payment confirmation through email so that the receiver confirms it and the payment status of both the members get updated in the application.

Lastly, to avoid confusion regarding movements of money and other stuffs related to settling up, all the major activities will be stored in the logs for each group.Also, contact information of all the group members are provided in each group.
